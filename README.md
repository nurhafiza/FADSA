Project: A New Hyper-Heuristic Algorithm (FADSA) for Gene Sequence Assembly.
Description: Heuristic of FA and heuristic of DSA were combined to solve gene sequence assembly.

Software Requirement: MATLAB R2015a
Experimental Data: 2 benchmark fragment datasets were used to study the performance of FADSA in solving gene sequence assembly.
                    1) x60189_4 (sequence of cluster of fibronectin type III repeats found in human major histocompatibility complex class III region)                   
                    2) m15421_6 (sequence of human apolipoprotein B gene)
** File format of both datasets are in the form of FASTA. Each dataset have provided the score of each possible overlap fragments in the form of matrices, 
   which make it easy for the optimiztion algorithm to maximize the overlap score between the fragments. Both datasets can be obtained from http://chac.sis.uia.mx/fragbench/
